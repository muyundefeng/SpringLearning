Ravish Kumar, who presents NDTV India's Prime Time, mock-interviewed two mimes about whether journalists should ask questions of the government, with the theme: "If we can't ask questions, what can we do?" The mimes, one cast as a government official - the other his supportive internet troll, responded to Mr Kumar with a mixture of threatening gestures, exaggerated facial expressions - gibberish.
